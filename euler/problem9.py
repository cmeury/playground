# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a  b  c, for which,
# a^2 + b^2 = c^2
#For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.
#There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
#Find the product abc.

# Idea: a^2 + b^2 = c^2 describes a triangle with a right angle between a and b
# So, we can apply the rules:
# cos alpha = a/b
