# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a  b  c, for which,
# a^2 + b^2 = c^2
#For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.
#There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
#Find the product abc.

# idea: for c^2, use (1000-a-b)^2
# on paper, one finds: (10^6-2000a)/(2000-2a) = b
# finding only two numbers that fit this equation is easier than finding three
